# Implementation Notes

---

## Week of 2026-01-26

### What I built
- Phase I interpreter: spaCy extraction + embedding-based intent classifier
- Task schema v1
- Baselines to be evaluated against (keyword, spaCy rules)
- Command template
- Evaluation script for Phase I

### What worked
- Basic single-step commands: "Go to the table and scan the room" / "Go to the table and bring the cup"

### What failed / edge cases
- Intent label mismatch for dual-step / multi-step commands (whole-command classifier can't handle multiple intents in one sentence — motivates Phase II clause-level classification)

### Decisions made (and why)
- Ambiguity thresholds tuned empirically (ambiguity_threshold=0.12, delta_threshold=0.015)
- SentenceTransformers instead of fine-tuning: faster iteration, no labeled training data required
- spaCy for extraction: pretrained, handles unstructured text, no extra training needed

### Finished
- Phase I interpreter + task schema v1
- Baselines (keyword + spaCy rules)
- evaluate_phase1.py
- Expand commands_gold.jsonl to 50 commands
- Tune ambiguity thresholds

### What I built
- Phase II clause splitter (split_clauses) using PhraseMatcher + verb heuristics
- build_phase2_plan(): clause-level task graph with per-clause intent + edges
- evaluate_phase2.py: four metrics (clause count, per-clause intent, step-sequence F1, edge-type)
- Annotated commands_gold.jsonl with gold_clause_count + gold_clause_intents for 14 multi-step examples
- Hybrid intent classifier: verb-override for short clauses + embedding fallback for longer/ambiguous text
- PLACE_VERBS set for placement-verb classification (put, place, set, drop, lay, leave)
- Phase III perception module (perception.py): YOLOv8 + SentenceTransformer affordance scoring
- Phase III evaluation script (evaluate_phase3.py): Top-1/3 accuracy, MRR, mean affordance score
- grounding_gold.jsonl: 20 annotated verb-scene-correct_object grounding examples
- Phase IV skill primitives (spot_skills.py): navigate, scan, locate, pick_up, deliver, release
- Phase IV executor (executor.py): task graph walker with retry logic and recovery clarifications

### What worked
- Clause splitting handles: "and" joins, "if/when" conditionals, comma+then, comma+verb sequences
- Hybrid classifier outperforms both baselines on intent accuracy
- Edge logic correctly uses destination clause relation (b, not a) for edge type assignment
- Affordance grounding achieves 85% Top-1, 90% Top-3 on 20-example gold set
- YOLOv8 + SentenceTransformer cosine similarity correctly grounds write→pen, drink→bottle, cut→scissors, carry→backpack
- Mock mode in both perception.py and spot_skills.py allows full pipeline testing without SPOT hardware
- Executor walks Phase II task graph clause by clause, retries failed steps, generates recovery clarifications

### What failed / edge cases (resolved)
- "next" in PhraseMatcher caused false split on "next to" → removed from connector phrases
- intent_labels.json descriptions too overlapping → rewrote with hard negative phrases per label
- Edge-type accuracy not firing → bug: was iterating clauses[:-1] instead of clauses[1:]
- "pick up" not caught by verb override → added "pick", "take" to FETCH_VERBS
- Placement verbs (put, place, set) predicted as locate_object → added PLACE_VERBS + override
- Token threshold too short (6) for commands like "Hand me the charger next to the laptop" → raised to 8
- ex034 three-clause split failing → added comma + verb heuristic to split_clauses
- GroundedObject not subscriptable in evaluate_phase3.py → fixed c["label"] → c.label
- found_score never set to True in evaluate_phase3.py → fixed, was double-counting affordance scores
- self.perecption typo in interpret.py → fixed to self.perception, was breaking evaluate_phase1/2

### Decisions made (and why)
- Verb-override at ≤8 tokens: embeddings are unreliable on short clauses; verb is the strongest signal
- Hard negative phrases in intent_labels.json: prevents multi_step_retrieve from dominating all embeddings
- Edge type assigned from destination clause (b.relation): connector belongs to the arriving clause, not departing
- perception.py as separate module (not integrated into interpret.py): perception and language are separate concerns with different dependencies; cleaner architecture and easier to explain in thesis
- CLIP considered but SentenceTransformer cosine similarity chosen for affordance scoring: already in stack, no additional model download, achieves 85% Top-1 which exceeds 70% thesis threshold
- GraphNav chosen for SPOT navigation: official BD recommendation for autonomous nav, waypoint IDs map cleanly to task graph navigate nodes
- Mock mode via USE_SPOT=false environment variable: allows offline testing of full pipeline without hardware access
- Embedder loaded twice (once in Phase1Interpreter, once in PerceptionModule) — known inefficiency, acceptable for now; shared instance to be passed in Phase V integration

### Known remaining failures (intentional — Phase III/IV motivation)
- select_object missing on vague commands ("bring me something to write with") → Phase III grounding resolves this at runtime via affordance best_match
- locate missing on implicit search commands ("bring me my keys") → requires perception context
- ex047 "Move the backpack" predicts navigate → "move" conflicts with navigate verb set; minor edge case
- Phase III failures g004 (read→pen), g014 (type→phone), g015 (open→phone) are all cases of bare verb ambiguity without object context — linguistically underspecified inputs, not model errors

### What I built
- evaluate_phase4.py: 20-trial dry-run eval (execution_gold.jsonl), reports task completion, plan accuracy, object/waypoint extraction, per-category breakdown, trial detail log
- execution_gold.jsonl: 20 annotated trials across 7 categories (navigate, retrieve_object, multi_step_retrieve, locate_object, scan_environment, vague_retrieve, edge_case)
- execution_trials.jsonl: per-run trial log output

### What worked (after fixes)
- All 7 categories pass at 100% after three targeted bug fixes
- Vague affordance grounding (write→pen, drink→bottle, sharp→scissors) fully wired end-to-end
- Bare edge case ("Bring me something") correctly fails and requests clarification
- Sentence-initial motion verbs ("Head to...") correctly parsed as navigate + multi-step retrieve

### What failed / edge cases (resolved)
- `vague_retrieve` 0/3: `ground_from_intent` was not stamping `affordance_verb` key → executor's `has_affordance_verb` check always False → hard block. Fix: stamp `result["affordance_verb"] = grounding_verb` only when a real functional verb or adjective modifier is found (not the intent-label fallback)
- p4020 "Bring me something" incorrectly succeeding: bare vague with no qualifier was resolving via intent-label fallback → added `found_functional_verb` flag; bare commands without a real grounding signal still block for clarification
- p4002 "Head to the kitchen and grab me a cup": two bugs — (1) "Head" mistagged as NOUN by spaCy → sentence-initial NAV_FIRST_TOKENS pre-check added to `classify_intent` before token-length gate; (2) "and" heuristic in `split_clauses` used `t.pos_ == "VERB"` for left_has_verb check, missed NOUN-tagged "Head" → added doc[0].lemma_ in `_MOTION_LEMMAS` fallback
- p4011 "Hand me something sharp": "sharp" is a postpositive adjective outside the spaCy noun chunk span → not captured by in-chunk modifier scan. Fix: added out-of-span `amod` scan (`t.head == chunk.root and t.dep_ == "amod" and t not in chunk`) to `extract_verbs_objects`; grounding then uses "sharp" as affordance signal → scissors

### Decisions made (and why)
- `affordance_verb` key as executor signal: cleaner than adding a separate `grounding_resolved` bool — the key presence carries both the signal and the verb used, useful for logging
- `found_functional_verb` flag vs. checking `grounding_verb != intent_label.replace(...)`: flag is more explicit and doesn't break if intent label wording changes
- Postpositive amod scan scoped to `t.head == chunk.root`: avoids capturing adjectives from other chunks in the same sentence
- Sentence-initial NAV_FIRST_TOKENS check runs before the ≤8-token gate: motion verb commands are unambiguous regardless of length; checking first token is O(1) and safe
